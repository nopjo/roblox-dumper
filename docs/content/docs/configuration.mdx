The dumper automatically configures itself on first run. You just need to answer a few simple questions.

## First Time Setup

When you run the dumper for the first time, it will ask you:

1. **Are you using the published dumper game?**

   - **Yes**: The dumper will automatically use the correct game IDs
   - **No**: You'll need to provide your custom game information

2. **If using a custom game:**

   - **Important**: Make sure you've uploaded the correct `.rblx` file from the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/nopjo/roblox-dumper/releases) to your Roblox game
   - Game ID (from the Roblox game URL)
   - Place ID
   - Creator ID

3. **Your user information:**
   - User ID (your Roblox user ID)
   - Display Name (your Roblox display name)

That's it! The configuration is saved to `dumper-config.json` automatically.

## Changing Configuration

If you need to use a different game or change your settings:

1. Delete `dumper-config.json` from the dumper folder
2. Run the dumper again
3. It will prompt you to enter new configuration

## Finding Your IDs

**Game ID**: Found in the Roblox game URL

- Example: `https://www.roblox.com/games/1234567890/GameName`
- The Game ID is `1234567890`

**Place ID**: Found in Roblox Studio under File → Game Settings

**Creator ID**: Found in the creator's profile URL

- Example: `https://www.roblox.com/users/123456789/profile`
- The Creator ID is `123456789`

**Your User ID**: Found in your own profile URL (same format as Creator ID)

## Using the Published Game

If you're using the published dumper game, just select "Yes" when asked. The dumper handles everything automatically - no IDs needed!
