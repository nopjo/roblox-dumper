# Setup Guide

Getting started with Roblox Dumper is very simple.

## Prerequisites

- Roblox Dumper downloaded from releases / built from source
- Cloudflare tunnel (included in the release)

## Step-by-Step Setup

### 1. Join the Dumper Game

Navigate to the Roblox Dumper game and join it:

[https://www.roblox.com/games/92369594709720/Dumper-v2](https://www.roblox.com/games/92369594709720/Dumper-v2)

### 2. Start Cloudflare Tunnel

Run the `cloudflare_tunnel.bat` file included in your download. This will start a local tunnel for communication between the game and the dumper.

### 3. Copy the Tunnel URL

Once the tunnel starts, you'll see a URL displayed in the terminal window. Copy this URL - you'll need it for the next step.

### 4. Run the Dumper

Execute the Roblox Dumper application. When prompted, paste the tunnel URL you copied in the previous step.

### 5. Generate Offsets

The dumper will automatically:

- Connect to the running Roblox process
- Scan memory for class and property offsets
- Generate offset files in all supported formats (C++, Python, C#, JSON)

## Output Files

After completion, you'll find the following files in your output directory:

- `offsets.h` - C++ header file
- `offsets.py` - Python file
- `offsets.cs` - C# file
- `offsets.json` - JSON file

## Troubleshooting

### Tunnel Connection Issues

- Ensure the tunnel is running before starting the dumper
- Make sure you copied the complete URL including `https://`
- Check your firewall settings aren't blocking the connection

### Roblox Not Detected

- Verify Roblox is running and you're in the Dumper v2 game
- Try running the dumper as administrator
- Ensure no antivirus is blocking the dumper
