Follow these steps to run the Roblox Dumper and generate offsets.

## Step 1: Start the Cloudflare Tunnel

1. **Run `cloudflare_tunnel.bat`**

   - This creates a local tunnel that the Roblox game needs to connect to
   - The script will automatically install cloudflared if needed

2. **Wait for the tunnel to start**

   - You'll see a message like "Starting tunnel..."
   - The tunnel will display a URL (something like `https://xxxxx.trycloudflare.com`)

3. **Copy the API URL**
   - You'll need this URL in the next step
   - Keep this window open while using the dumper

## Step 2: Enter API URL in Roblox Game

1. **Start the Roblox game**

   - Use the [published dumper game](https://www.roblox.com/games/6923982205/Dumper) or your configured custom game
   - Wait for the game to fully load

2. **Enter the API URL**
   - Look for the API URL input field in the game
   - Paste the URL from the Cloudflare tunnel (e.g., `https://xxxxx.trycloudflare.com`)
   - Then press Start

## Step 3: Run the Dumper

1. **Run `roblox-dumper.exe`**

   - The dumper will attach to the Roblox process
   - It will start a control server on port 8000

2. **Wait for scanning to complete**

   - The dumper will run through all scanning phases
   - You'll see progress messages for each phase

3. **Find your offsets**
   - When complete, `offsets.hpp` will be generated in the same directory as the executable
   - The file contains all the dumped offsets ready to use

## Troubleshooting

**"Failed to attach to Roblox"**

- Make sure Roblox is running
- Make sure you're running the dumper as administrator
- Try restarting both Roblox and the dumper

**"Failed to start control server"**

- Port 8000 might be in use
- Close any programs using port 8000
- Try running as administrator

**"Dumping failed"**

- Make sure you're using the correct game configuration
- If you're using a custom game make sure you uploaded it correctly
- Verify your user information is correct
- Make sure the API URL was entered correctly in the Roblox game

**Cloudflare tunnel issues**

- Make sure the tunnel window stays open
- If the tunnel disconnects, restart it and update the URL in the game
- Check your internet connection
