# External Roblox Dumper

## What Is Roblox Dumper?

Roblox Dumper is a tool that connects to a running Roblox game and automatically scans memory to find offsets for various classes and properties. It generates offset files in multiple formats that you can use in your own external/projects.

**Note:** As of version 2.0, the dumper has been completely rewritten with huge changes to the codebase. The Lua game has been made private for the time being.

## Offset Files

Pre-generated offset files are available in multiple formats:

- C++ Header: [offsets.h](https://dumper.jonah.cool/offsets.h)
- Python: [offsets.py](https://dumper.jonah.cool/offsets.py)
- C#: [offsets.cs](https://dumper.jonah.cool/offsets.cs)
- JSON: [offsets.json](https://dumper.jonah.cool/offsets.json)
