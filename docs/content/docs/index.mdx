## What Is Roblox Dumper?

Roblox Dumper is a tool that connects to a running Roblox game and automatically scans memory to find offsets for various classes and properties. It generates offset files in multiple formats that you can use in your own external tools and projects.

**Note:** As of version 2.0, the dumper has been completely rewritten with significant changes to the codebase. The Lua game has been made private for the time being.

## Pre-Generated Offset Files

Pre-generated offset files are available and updated regularly:

- **C++ Header**: [offsets.h](https://dumper.jonah.cool/offsets.h)
- **Python**: [offsets.py](https://dumper.jonah.cool/offsets.py)
- **C#**: [offsets.cs](https://dumper.jonah.cool/offsets.cs)
- **JSON**: [offsets.json](https://dumper.jonah.cool/offsets.json)

## Need More Offsets?

Need additional offsets that aren't currently being dumped? Reach out on Discord and I'll try to add them.
